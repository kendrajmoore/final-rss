  <description><![CDATA[<div>Happy Thanksgiving everyone! On this week's episode of Coffee Convos Kail and Lindsie are dreaming big and talking about podcast live shows. Kail recently attended one and it got her thinking about what it would be like for Coffee Convos to go on tour. And Lindsie just welcomed a new puppy into her family! She talks about her journey to find Georgia and how things have evolved since bringing her home. But this got Kail and Lindsie thinking; how do relationships with pets change when you have kids? And how does the situation look different when the pet has been around longer than the children and vice versa. And when you start single parenting there are things that come up that you never saw coming. Kail and Lindsie discuss some of the surprising aspects of being a single parent household. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>With the holiday season quickly approaching Kail and Lindsie are talking about the more stressful side of the holidays, gift giving. There can be so much pressure to give certain types of gifts, and there are no rules to follow! And there can be even more pressure when you receive for gifts you didn't want or ask for. And so many artists are dropping new music right now, and Lindsie has been relating HARD to some of it. Kail and Lindsie discuss the new Adele album and the special that premiered this last week. And listeners have been wanting to know how Kail and Lindsie decide to cut off toxic people. What are the signs they need to be out of your life, and how do you go about it?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's episode Kail and Lindsie are joined by author of <em>What To Expect When You're Expecting, </em>Heidi Murkoff. Heidi talks about how she came to write the book, and how it has evolved and taken on a life of it's own since the original release. Lindsie, Kail, and Heidi talk about how difficult it can be to find out information about pregnancy, especially when everyone online thinks they know the best and only way to do things. Heidi believes at the end of the day, the best thing you can do is to make your own decision about what is best for you and your baby. And there are so many women and parents who do not feel that initial connection with their baby. Heidi discusses why you should not be ashamed, and what to do to make that bond stronger every single day.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>This week on Coffee Convos Lindsie and Kail are talking about the trouble with exchanging time in co-parenting. When life gets in the way, exchanging time can get messy, and when the kids are stuck in the middle it's a bad situation all around. Lindsie talks about her first experience dealing with plans changing without a discussion, and how it made her feel. Plus Kail talks about her own experiences over the years, and says what she has learned. Does anyone ever feel like a "B-List Friend"? When you always feel like a second choice it can be hard not to take it personally. And having both been on reality shows Kail and Lindsie discuss how things are "scripted" and how they are not. Every show is different, and some are more scripted than others. <br>

First Kail wants to know what Lindsie's opinion on participation trophies is and whether or not they are beneficial. Then Lindsie brings up some listener questions, starting with divorce vs. separation. It can be difficult to decide what course of action is best for a relationship. Lindsie and Kail talk about their own past relationships and the choices they made when ending them. What would they change and what would they keep the same? And while co-parenting sometimes you miss important firsts and milestones in your child's life. How can you cope and what choices can you and your co-parenting partner make to minimise the loss?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's episode, Kail and Lindsie get real about letting go when you move out of a house. It can be sad to think about all of the time spent there and what that space used to mean. Lindsie talks about her emotions as the house she used to live in was finally sold. And when people get divorced it can be tricky to set boundaries and to know what's right, especially for the kids. Kail and Lindsie talk about their own relationships and their worries about how it might affect their children. And as parents we always want to do what is best for our kids, but at the end of the day we can never be sure. Sometimes it's just a matter of doing what you think is best at the time. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's episode Kail and Lindsie chat about feeling scatterbrained when it comes to tasks. Kail's therapist has a new theory about what is going on with her bad memory, but she is not entirely convinced. Does anyone else feel like they can never finish a task before moving on to the next? And as Lindsie continues to navigate co-parenting and the new boundaries that come with it, she and Kail discuss the importance of establishing a good foundation in the relationship. The future is unknown, but having a solid foundation can help support any changes that may come. And Lindsie opens up about her miscarriage a few years ago. Kail and Lindsie both discuss how having a miscarriage affected them, and how sometimes you need to believe that everything happens for a reason. <br>

You are invited to do something, but then the day rolls around and you just don't what to go, so you make up a fake excuse? What if we were just honest with people instead of stressing and lying. And as parents there can be so much anxiety about being away from your kids, even if they are just at school. Lindsie talks about her struggles with fearing that something could happen to her son, and Kail talks about always being on guard. Plus sometimes things just feel right! Lindsie talks about her long journey to finding her next home, and how everything fell into place. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>With the launch of Lindsie's second podcast this week Kail and Lindsie discuss showing friends and peers support for their projects. There is room for everyone to succeed, and it's so much easier to show love than tearing each other down. Then it's time for a blast from the past as Lindsie and Kail discuss their middle school days! Lunch table hierarchies, fashion choices, and a whole lot of jelly sandals talk! And after weeks of saying they should discuss it, Kail and Lindsie finally break down Demi Lovato's documentary <em>Dancing with the Devil</em>. Often times we are putting on a show for the public eye, but behind closed doors it's a different story.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>As Kail and Lindsie prepare to meet up in Philly there are a few things to discuss, mainly Kail's plan to introduce Lindsie to a Puerto Rican restaurant she loves. There have been a lot of requests to talk more about homeschooling, so Kail and Lindsie discuss their opinions and whether or not they would consider homeschooling their own kids. Lindsie's son Jackson has been asking to get a dog, but Lindsie just doesn't know which breed is right for her family. Kail gives some suggestions based on her extensive dog knowledge from childhood. And Lindsie has been thinking a lot recently about why it's expected for women to change their last names when they get married. And what happens when a couple with kids gets divorced? Would the mom want to keep the same last name as her kids?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's episode of Coffee Convos, Kail and Lindsie revisit some recent topics. You all have been asking for some updated opinions about pandemic related topics, so Kail and Lindsie chat about school situations and how teachers are having to teach. Recently Kail has been trying to get her son Creed in to see a specialist about being tongue tied, but she had a less than pleasant experience at the doctor's office. Good thing she has some amazing people on her side to validate her, and advocate for her! And last week Kail and Lindsie talked about the new TV show <em>A Teacher, </em>and wanted to know if any listeners had heard of anything like that happening at their schools. You all did not disappoint with the submissions! <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>This week's episode of Coffee Convos is brought to you by a lot of food motivated topics. Lindsie and Kail discuss some of their Thanksgiving plans; Kail will be spending it with her friend who she hasn't been able to see in quite a while, and Lindsie is hoping to get as much prep done ahead of time as possible so she can enjoy the day with her family. Lindsie is hoping that Kail will be able to come back from her trip with some new recipes to tell her, and Kail recently had a funny incident happen involving buying the snack to her son's football team. The fall typically brings Parent Teacher Conference time for most parents, and Kail and Lindsie reminisce about their childhood thoughts on those. And when you are a busy mom in the go it can be easy to neglect doing things to make yourself feel good. Lindsie recently learned of a strategy she intends to try out, and it hoping to inspire other busy moms to do the same. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Lindsie's audio mishaps journey has finally (fingers crossed) come to an end. Finally all the equipment is working, and she lets listeners know all about the road to fixing the problem. Then Lindsie and Kail talk about a super interesting article about a woman who was not a genetic match to the children she gave birth to. And holidays can be hard, especially where there is tension between family members. Lindsie tells Kail about some tough decisions she has made recently, and the hard conversations she has had about it. Sometimes you just need to do what's best for yourself. Plus, some actual coffee convos, on this week's episode of Coffee Convos.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Kail and Lindsie would like to thank you all for being patient with the late release this week. Tech issues are the worst, but missing audio will not stop them from discussing some major topics this week! When you sign your kids up for activities, who would have guessed that was teaching them lessons about commitment? And this week Kail and Lindsie have two separate true crime stories to catch up on. If you have been listening lately you will know about the ongoing case right in Kail's area, and she has some updates about that. Plus you all had a lot to say about <em>American Murder: The Family Next Door, </em>and Kail and Lindsie have done some more digging. This episode of Coffee Convos was well worth the wait!<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>While Kail is out on maternity leave, Lindsie is joined by her friend Karley Lane, to catch up and discuss what has been on their minds lately. With so much celebrity drama always in the news, sometimes it's hard to remember that they are only human. Sometimes their lives can look pretty similar to everyone else's. As relationships change, how do people navigate the situations that come along with it? Being friends with your spouse after a divorce, co-parenting, and the feelings that come with it. And with so much conflicting information about things these days, how exactly do we decide our own opinions, and make conclusions about what is true? Lindsie and her friend Carly discuss all this and more! <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Coffee Convos is celebrating their 100th podcast episode! Kail and Lindsie start this monumental episode by reflecting on all the things they've filmed, and what it's been like to deal with the public's opinion along the way. Kail addresses an issue she's experiencing with her dog being up to no good. The dynamic duo also discuss having so much going on in their lives, but simultaneously feeling like nothing's actually going on at all. Can you relate? Lindsie ask for advice on how to coordinate her days when Jackson is back at school, &amp; why it’s been such a hard adjustment for her. Kail proposes the possibility of opening a restaurant. They talk about updates in the chilling Chris Watts murder case, &amp; give their thoughts on the most recent developments. The couple also talk about the strange process of associating emotion with “things” &amp; why they both don’t attach themselves emotionally to houses or cars etc. Kail shares her experiences with her recent visit to PennHurst Haunted Asylum &amp; why she has so many questions after going. Lindsie shares as to why places like PennHurst should no exploit in poor taste as an attraction that families loved ones were once housed, and restrict their labeling as a historical site only. Conversation moves swiftly on to the popular clothing company Forever 21 filing for bankruptcy, &amp; how a lot of girls are going to suffer from this catastrophic closing. They talk about how people read way deeper into things on social media than they really should, &amp; why they feel that friendships/relationships shouldn’t be based off of different beliefs. Kail and Lindsie round off their 100th podcast by completing a thorough clean out of a year's worth of old pictures, and laugh at their seemingly crazy collection of screenshots, that any normal person would struggle to understand. This and more, on this week's 100th Coffee Convos Podcast, hosted by Kail Lowry and Lindsie Chrisley. </p>

The couple have fun discussing Lindsie's personality, noting that Lindise is not like your average TV personality. Lindsie shares a story about Jackson receiving a Game Medal for his soccer skills.

They both wonder, like we all do, whether people are stealing things out of unattended strollers in the park? They talk about bullying incidents at school, and give great insight from a parents perspective. Is it true that your meanest friend is the one that wants what’s best for you? They talk about volunteering at school, field trips, and also what it’s like being a helicopter parent, rounding things off with a fun and relatable Q&amp;A! </p>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On this week's Coffee Convos Podcast, Lindsie Chrisley and Kail Lowry discuss the craziness that is the airport, and what it's like traveling for work and with kids.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>On their first episode, Kail and Lindsie open up about how they became friends, and how reality TV helped them bond even though they have totally different backgrounds. They share why having time to just talk to each other without the kids is like therapy for them, and how they want the show to be a help to others who need a break from it all. They talk about how hard it is sometimes to be in the public eye--especially as parents. Plus, Lindsie has a yummy recipe she's raving about (and is confusing Kail). This is the first of many, so don't forget to subscribe and give them a 5-star review!</p>
